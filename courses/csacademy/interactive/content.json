  "title": "Interactive Animation Remix: onKeyHold + hitsShape",
  "description": "Students refactor a CMU CS Academy animation by replacing the automatic onStep loop with keyboard-controlled onKeyHold logic. They keep a grouped character intact, detect collisions with hitsShape(), and use conditional statements plus shared speed variables (app.xSpeed/app.ySpeed) to decide how both the character and another object respond to each key press.",
  "understandings": [
    "Event handlers like onKeyHold() let students control WHEN movement happens instead of looping constantly in onStep.",
    "hitsShape() returns a Boolean value that can trigger new actions (like pushing a ball) the instant two shapes touch.",
    "Conditional statements determine different movement or collision responses for each arrow key.",
    "Speed belongs in variables (for example app.xSpeed) so it can be reused, reversed, or scaled from one place.",
    "Grouping shapes (Group objects) keeps a multi-part character aligned when it moves or resizes.",
    "Refactoring an animation means keeping prior behavior (rotation, scaling) while layering on interactive rules."
  ],
  "essentialQuestions": [
    "Why would you replace onStep with onKeyHold in an interactive scene?",
    "How does hitsShape() help you decide when two objects should push, bounce, or stop?",
    "What role do conditional statements play when mapping keys to different movement or collision outcomes?",
    "How do shared speed variables make it easier to tune or reverse motion?",
    "What strategies keep a complex, multi-shape character moving as a single unit?"
  ],
  "reflectionPrompts": [
    "Describe a moment when hitsShape() returned True. How did that collision change what happened next?",
    "Where do you use conditional statements inside onKeyHold(), and how did they help you control different arrow keys?",
    "Explain how app.xSpeed or app.ySpeed influenced your project. How would the project change if you doubled or reversed those values?"
