    "classLength": "74 Minutes",
     "overview": "Unit 3 focuses on abstraction and effective program design, emphasizing how design choices impact readability, maintainability, and efficiency. Students analyze the structure of a Java class, learning about constructors, instance and class variables, and method creation. They explore how methods pass and return object references, understanding the implications for memory and program behavior. Concepts of scope and access control are introduced to manage data security and encapsulation. The this keyword is examined as a tool for distinguishing instance variables from parameters, reinforcing best practices in object-oriented programming.",
